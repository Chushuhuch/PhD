\section{The necessary conditions for inequality (\ref{toprove})}

Here we refer to several assertions from \cite{1dim}.
They are proved in \cite{1dim} for one-dimensional case, but the proofs of a multidimensional analogues given here are the same.

For simplicity we omit parameters $x'$ and $v$ of the weight $a$ in this section.
This means that all inequalities hold for any $x' \in \omega, v \in \Real_+$.
In particular, we put $a( x', y, v ) \equiv a( y )$.

\begin{prop}
{\rm \cite[Theorem 1]{1dim}.}
{\bf 1.} Suppose inequality $(\ref{toprove})$ holds for some $F \in \mathfrak{F}$
and arbitrary piecewise linear $u$.
Then the weight $a$ is even in $y$.

{\bf 2.} Suppose inequality $(\ref{toprove})$ holds for arbitrary $F \in \mathfrak{F}$
and arbitrary piecewise linear $u$.
Then the weight $a$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\label{almostConcave}
a( s ) + a( t ) \ge a( 1 - t + s ), \qquad -1 \le s \le t \le 1.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{rem}
Any nonnegative weight $a$, which is even and concave with respect to $y$, satisfies condition $(\ref{almostConcave})$.
Indeed, for any $(s, t)$ we have $a( 1 ) - a( s ) \le a( t ) - a( -1 + t - s )$.
And since $a( 1 ) \ge 0$ we get $a( s ) + a( t ) \ge a( -1 + t - s ) = a( 1 - t + s )$.
The converse in general is not true, that is there are even nonnegative functions satisfying $(\ref{almostConcave})$ which are not concave.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
\label{lanNec}
Suppose $u(\cdot, -1) \equiv 0$.
Then condition (\ref{almostConcave}) is necessary for inequality (\ref{toprove}) to hold.
\end{rem}

\begin{prop}
\label{weightSum}
{\rm \cite[Lemma 1]{1dim}.}
Consider a continuous function $a \ge 0$ defined on $[-1,1]$
and satisfying (\ref{almostConcave}).
Then for any $-1 \le t_1 \le t_2 \le \ldots \le t_m \le 1$ we have
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^m a(t_k) & \ge a( 1 - \sum_{k = 1}^m (-1)^k t_k ), & \text{ for even $m$},&\\
\sum_{k=1}^m a(t_k) & \ge a( -\sum_{k = 1}^m (-1)^k t_k ),    & \text{ for odd $m$}.&
\end{align*}
\end{prop}
