\subsection{The proof of the inequality (\ref{toproveSymm})}
\label{sobolevSymm}

\begin{thm}
\label{symmThm}
Suppose $F \in \mathfrak{F}$, the function $u \in \W(-1, 1)$ is non-negative,
and the continuous weight function $\mathfrak a: [-1, 1] \times \Real_+ \to \Real_+$
is even and convex in the first argument.
Then the inequality $(\ref{toproveSymm})$ holds.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
As we mentioned in the introduction,
the theorem is proved for Lipschitz functions $u$ in paper \cite{Br}.
Thus, we need only to extend it to $\W$-functions.

The shape of convex weights is much easier
than the one of the weights we considered in the case of a monotone permutation.
Convex weight decreases for $x < 0$ and increases for $x > 0$
irrespective of $v$.
Thus, they immediately enter the condition $(H6)$ from Theorem \ref{mainThm}.
To enter the condition $(H7)$, we apply Lemma \ref{zeroApprox}
with the set $W = \{ u(0) \}$ .
This gives us the opportunity to immediately apply step 1 of the proof,
and prove the inequality (\ref{toproveSymm}) in general form.
Note that step 1 uses only the conditions $(H1)$, $(H6)$, $(H7)$,
so there is no need to check conditions $(H2)-(H5)$.
\end{proof}
