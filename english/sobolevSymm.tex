\subsection{The proof of inequality (\ref{toproveSymm})}
\label{sobolevSymm}

\begin{thm}
\label{symmThm}
Suppose that $F \in \mathfrak{F}$, the function $u \in \W(-1, 1)$ is nonnegative,
and the continuous weight function $\mathfrak a: [-1, 1] \times \Real_+ \to \Real_+$
is even and convex with respect to the first argument.
Then inequality $(\ref{toproveSymm})$ holds.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
As we mentioned in the introduction,
the statement is proved for Lipschitz functions $u$ in paper \cite{Br}.
Thus, we need only to extend it to $\W$-functions.

The case of convex weight is much simpler than the case considered in Section \ref{moveForth}.
Namely, the function $\mathfrak a$ decreases for $x < 0$ and increases for $x > 0$ regardless of $v$.
Thus, assumption $(H6)$ of Theorem \ref{mainThm} is satisfied.
To fulfil assumption $(H7)$, we apply Lemma \ref{zeroApprox} with $W = \{ u(0) \}$.
Then we can use immediately Step 1 of the proof of Theorem \ref{mainThm}.
This gives us (\ref{toproveSymm}).
Since Step 1 uses assumptions $(H1)$, $(H6)$, $(H7)$ only,
we do not need to check $(H2)-(H5)$.
\end{proof}
