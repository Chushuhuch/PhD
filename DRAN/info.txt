13. Abstract (English, not more than 12 lines 80 characters yech):
Polya-Szego typed weighted inequality considered. Necessary conditions on the
weight discussed. Inequality proved for monotone rearrangement with
restrictions on weight and in general case for symmetrization. The case with
minimum of the function on the left end of the segment analyzed.
